Dear {{ given_names }} {{ surname }},

The Australian Electoral Commission audits each
non-parliamentary political party once per election cycle.

This means that all full members that the Party submits to
the AEC for the purposes of our continued registration have
a chance of being contacted by an AEC representative to
confirm that they are in fact a member.

We are asking you to confirm that you consent to being
contacted by the AEC for the purposes of ensuring the
Pirate Party remains registered for Federal elections, and
that you confirm your contact and enrolment details are
up-to-date.

A snippet of current information we have for you includes:

* Email: {{ email }}
* Primary phone (masked): {{ mask(primary_phone) }}
* Residential postcode: {{ residential_postcode }}

If this information seems accurate for your enrolment and
for contact purposes, please confirm by clicking the link
below:

If that information seems out of date or you wish to review
our records, you can securely view and update your
membership details below:

If however you wish to resign your membership, please click
