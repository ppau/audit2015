Dear {{ given_names }} {{ surname }},

You are receiving this email because you are listed as a
member of Pirate Party Australia and enrolled to vote in
New South Wales.

The Pirate Party is in the process of registering a NSW
branch for local elections in NSW. We need your help to
ensure this process is completed by the end of June or we
will not be able to register before the next election.

You are required to:

(1) Fill out the form provided using BLUE OR BLACK PEN,
(2) Write verbatim "Pirate Party Australia (NSW Branch)"
    into the "Full name of the Party" field,
(3) Mail the form to the following address as soon as
    possible (run now!):

    PO Box 385
    Figtree NSW 2525
    Australia

Don't forget to enter all of your details EXACTLY AS THEY
WOULD APPEAR ON THE ELECTORAL ROLL:

https://pirateparty.org.au/w/images/b/b4/NSW_Application_Form.pdf

It is required by NSW law that you FILL IT OUT BY HAND
USING BLUE OR BLACK PEN. Do not diverge from this or the
form will be considered invalid. They are very strict about
this because democracy. If you have a writing disability,
please let us know and we will make alternative
arrangements for you.

Once you have mailed your form to us, it would be much
appreciated if you could return to this email and click
this link to let the Secretary know to check the mailbox:

It is a requirement of the Party Constitution[1] that all
members of Pirate Party Australia are members of their
local state branch. You will continue to receive reminders
to provide this form until it is received.

We apologise for New South Wales electoral law being such a
nightmare. Please do however spare a thought for your
Secretary who has to receive and manage the organisation
of these hand-written forms due to these archaic,
anti-democratic laws.

We thank you for your continued support!

Apologies for the yelling too. If you had HTML email
enabled, you would have seen bold text instead. ;)
