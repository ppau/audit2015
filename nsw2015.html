<p>Dear {{ given_names }} {{ surname }},</p>

<p>The Pirate Party is in the process of registering a NSW
branch for local elections in NSW. We need your help to
ensure this process is completed by the end of June or we
will not be able to register before the next election.</p>

<p>You are required:

<ol>
  <li>To fill out the form provided using <strong>blue or black pen</strong>,</li>
  <li>To write verbatim <em>Pirate Party Australia (NSW Branch)</em> into the
    "Full name of the Party" field,</li>
  <li>To mail the form to the following address <strong>as soon as
      possible (run now!)</strong>:

  Australia
</strong></blockquote>

    would appear on the electoral roll</strong>:</p>

<p>It is required by NSW law that you <strong>fill it out by hand
using blue or black pen</strong>. Do not diverge from this or the
form will be considered invalid. They are very strict about
this because <em>democracy</em>. If you have a writing disability,
please let us know and we will make alternative
arrangements for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://join.pirateparty.org.au/nsw/{{ member_id }}">I have mailed my form!</a></p>

<p>It is a requirement of the <a href="https://pirateparty.org.au/constitution/#2.1(5)">Party Constitution</a> that all
members of Pirate Party Australia are members of their
local state branch. You will continue to receive reminders
to provide this form until it is received.</p>

<p>We apologise for New South Wales electoral law being such a
nightmare. Please do however spare a thought for your
Secretary who has to receive and manage the organisation
of these hand-written forms due to these archaic,
anti-democratic laws.</p>

<p>We thank you for your continued support!</p>
