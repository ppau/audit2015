<p>Dear {{ given_names }} {{ surname }},</p>

<p>The Australian Electoral Commission audits each non-parliamentary political party once per election cycle.</p>

<p>This means that all full members that the Party submits to the AEC for the purposes of our continued registration have a chance of being contacted by an AEC representative to confirm that they are in fact a member.</p>

<p>We are asking you to confirm that you consent to being contacted by the AEC for the purposes of ensuring the Pirate Party remains registered for Federal elections, and that you confirm your contact and enrolment details are up-to-date.</p>

<li>Email: <strong>{{ email }}</strong>
<li>Primary phone (masked): <strong>{{ mask(primary_phone) }}</strong>
<li>Residential postcode: <strong>{{ residential_postcode }}</strong>
